		<h1>Jorge Sintes Fernández</h1>
		
		<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p> Combining my studies with my work as a musician has helped me to become an <em>open-
			minded and communicative person</em>, that enjoys <em>team-working</em> and with an <em>eye for detail</em>. My recent specialization in Mathematical Modelling and Computation, together with the set of technical skills earned from my background in General Engineering, provide me a <em>wider understanding</em> of the field and a <em>“think outside the box” attitude</em> when it comes to <em>problem-solving</em>.</p>

		<h2>MSc and Personal Projects</h2>

		<h3>Time Series Anomaly Detection using Variational AutoEncoders and GRU cells</h3>
		Danmarks Tekniske Universitet <img src="calendar.svg" alt="calendar" height="20"> 02/2021 - 05/2021 <img src="link.svg" alt="link" height="20"> <a href="https://github.com/JorgeSintes/Advanced_Machine_Learning" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
		<p>Scientific paper researching the potential of using VAEs in combination with Recurrent Neural Networks for anomaly detection on time-series data. </p>
		<p>Succesfully designed and built +6 models combining these techniques. The models manage to detect anomalies on the condition of the roads using data collected from Green Mobility cars, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques.</p>

		<h3>Other projects</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Several different projects involving a broad variety of topics: time series analysis, real time outlier detection, image analysis, deep learning, mathematical models of dynamical systems, big data treatment and analysis, high performance computing, optimization, algorithms and data structures...
