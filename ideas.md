With a little description of myself (About me) with links to my social media and each square a link to the different main pages:

## Resumé
Here I'll upload a modified version of my Resumé. Maybe include the option to download as a PDF.

## Projects/Blog/Things
Here I'd like to have different projects or ideas I come up with. First should be the Advance Machine Learning project. 
Cool ideas:
	Interactive Sudoku solver is always nice
	Simulation of a dynamical system with some explanation about the theory/ visualization using pplane and so on. There's books about computational physics using python and things like that
	Maybe using some of the codes from Algorithms and Data Structures II would be nice. Christmas trees or something. Maybe doing a tutorial explanation about why it works with a viz coded in JavaScript

## Miscellaneous
Here I would like to upload some of my photos and the videoclip for un cuento más. Also, if I end up doing a worthy cover with the guitar it may be a nice touch.
